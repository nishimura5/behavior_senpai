Behavior Senpai is an application designed for quantitative behavioral observation. It converts the behavior of people recorded on video cameras into time-series coordinate data using keypoint detection AI. This time-series coordinate data is then used to quantitatively analyze human behavior.

Additionally, Behavior Senpai serves as a project for learning data analysis using Python. It is structured to provide a stepping stone for individuals who have mastered the basics of Python (such as if statements, for loops, list comprehensions, and classes) to challenge themselves in developing practical applications. In particular, it offers the opportunity to learn about the following libraries:

 - MultiIndex in Pandas
 - Time-series data plotting with Matplotlib
 - VideoCapture in OpenCV (cv2)

The AI models currently supported by Behavior Senpai are as follows:

 - YOLOv8
 - MediaPipe Holistic

## Requirement 

 - Free Space: More than 8GB
 - RAM: More than 8GB (16GB or more recommended)

Behavior Senpai has been developed and tested in a Python environment constructed on Rye running on Windows 11 (23H2). For information about the libraries being used, please refer to pyproject.toml or similar documents.

However, since Behavior Senpai only utilizes libraries that can be installed via pip, it is possible to set up the environment using other methods apart from Rye, such as Miniconda.

## Usage

### Windows
For setting up a Python environment on Windows, please refer to this video.

Clone this project into your working folder. Execute the following commands. Ensure that the parent folder does not contain any Japanese characters.

```
git clone https://github.com/nishimura5/behavior_senpai.git
cd behavior_senpai
```

If you are using Rye, simply execute the following to prepare for launching Behavior Senpai.

```
rye sync
```

If you want to enable CUDA, remove the comment out in [pyproject.toml][pyproject] before sync.

```
[[tool.rye.sources]]
name = "torch"
url = "https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118"
type = "index"
```

After setting up the environment, either run launcher.bat or execute [launcher.py][launcher] with the following command to start the application.

```
python src/launcher.py
```

### Mac
On Mac, we recommend using Miniconda. Please set up the environment using pip.

```
pip install torch
pip install ultralytics
pip install lapx
pip install mediapipe
pip install scikit-learn
pip install pyperclip
```

After setting up the environment, execute [launcher.py][launcher] with the following command to start the application.

```
python src/launcher.py
```

â€»In the Mac&Rye environment, we have identified issues related to the tkinter backend, which may cause instability. For example, we have confirmed a failure in importing matplotlib.backends.backend_tkagg on Mac&Rye. To address this issue, we have implemented an alternative branch for cases when the import of backend_tkagg fails.

Also, if you are using Rye on Mac, please remove the comment out in pyproject.toml.

```
"pyqt5>=5.15.10",
```
